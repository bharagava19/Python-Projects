# Project Title: Producing Graphic Models using Tkinter Module in Python
# Abstract:
The "Producing Graphic Models using Tkinter Module in Python" project aims to demonstrate how to create graphical models and interactive visualizations using the Tkinter library in Python. Tkinter is a standard GUI toolkit that allows developers to build graphical user interfaces, including windows, dialogs, buttons, and canvas elements for creating graphics.

This project provides a hands-on approach to understand the basics of Tkinter, such as creating and configuring widgets, handling contact name and mobile number and storing into the contact management data.
