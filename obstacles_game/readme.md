PROJECT TITLE :OBSTACLES GAME

ABSTRACT :

The "OBSTACLES Python Project" is a recreation of the classic OBSTACLE game using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The project aims to demonstrate how to develop a simple 2D game with basic physics and interactive gameplay. Players control a BLOCK, trying to navigate it through gaps in a series of blocks without colliding with them.

This project provides an opportunity for learners to understand game development concepts, such as game loops, collision detection, scoring, and user input handling. It serves as a fun and educational example of building a game from scratch using Python and Pygame.
